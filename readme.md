This repository contains a Flask-based proxy designed to facilitate integration between Label Studio and Hugging Face Spaces for NER tasks. The proxy acts as a middleware layer, receiving annotation requests from Label Studio, converting them into the format required by Hugging Face, and then forwarding the reformatted data to the designated Space for further processing.

## How It Works
This proxy server works automatically, acting as a bridge between your huggingface space and label studio
- Label Studio sends annotation data to the Flask proxy
- The proxy processes and reformats the data to match Hugging Faceâ€™s requirements
- Reformatted data is forwarded to the Hugging Face Space for further action

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Partha11/flask-proxy
cd path/to/flask-proxy
```
Create a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
For Linux & OS X

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
For Windows with CMD

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
For Windows with Powershell

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

## Configuration

Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env, I.E:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Add your huggingface space url and huggingface token to the environment file, which will be used by the proxy server.

## Usage example

Start the server by using this command

```python
python -m src.main
```

After the server starts, it will accept request on the `/predict` endpoint

For connecting it with Label Studio, please check [Wiki][wiki].

## To Do
These are the list of tasks that will be done to this project

- [x] Add LLM for prediction
- [ ] Add data for healthcheck endpoint
- [ ] Migrate label studio configuration to a separate file
